# Deeplearning cars
- Using Unity

In this project cars, which were controlled by simple fully connected neural network, were tasked to navigate through various paths and avoid obstacles.

- Neural network was transformed using unsupervised training (evolution algorithm) with early exit.
- Fitness was calculated using travelled distance and time (but distance was preffered over speed).
